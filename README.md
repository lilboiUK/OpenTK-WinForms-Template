# OpenTK WinForms Template

Description:
This repository provides a basic template for developing Windows Forms applications with the OpenTK library, 
which allows for rendering graphics using OpenGL. 
The template includes the necessary code structure and setup to create an OpenGL context, 
load shaders, and render a simple scene.

Key Features:

1. Windows Forms application template with OpenGL rendering support
2. Integration with the OpenTK library for OpenGL functionality
3. Basic shader loading and rendering setup
4. Automatic update and rendering loop with delta time calculation
5. Handling of form resizing and viewport adjustment

Usage:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the solution in your preferred development environment.
3. Build the solution to resolve dependencies.
4. Explore and modify the MainForm class to implement your desired rendering logic and user interactions.
5. Run the application to see the OpenGL-rendered scene and observe the basic example of a triangle with a color changing backgorund.

Note: 
This template is intended to provide a starting point for Windows Forms applications with OpenGL rendering. 
It's recommended to customize and extend the code according to your specific requirements, 
such as incorporating additional shaders, implementing input handling, or managing more complex rendering scenarios.
